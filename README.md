In the dataTemplate table you add all things you want the user to save, it could be inventory = {}, coins = 0 or anything you would like!

Modify the leaderstats or remove them completely, you decide from what your game needs!

Clone it directly into your Rojo project or copy paste the code into your Roblox Project!

Good luck with your game!
